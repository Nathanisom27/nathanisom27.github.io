# What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated
# top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda,
# and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the
# entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck
# out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking
# words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again,
# fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being
# traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the
# pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime,
# and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I
# extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United
# States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face
# of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your
# little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking
# tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will
# shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
