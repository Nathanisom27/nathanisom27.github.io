<p>
After setting your correct locale in the etc/locale.gen file and running
locale-gen, your system wide language gets set in Linux. Some
applications, however, reference the LANG variable in order to determine
language type. One in particular that I am fond of is sublime text. This
isn't an issue until you install the package manager - which you will
probably want to do eventually.
</p>

<p>
A temporary fix, as the error logged will inform you, is to set the LANG
variable either before or with the startup of sublime text.
</p>

<p>
However, this may not always be viable, and can be annoying. There are
two solutions to set this variable upon system startup.
</p>

<p>
A "hacky" way to get around this problem would be to set the LANG
variable within your .bashrc file, as such:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
export LANG ="en\<sub>US.UTF</sub>-8"
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, the above only sets the variable for your user/login session.
</p>

<p>
To set the LANG variable system wide(the prefferred method), edit or
create the file /etc/locale.conf to contain:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
LANG ="en\<sub>US.UTF</sub>-8"
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And upon restart your LANG variable will be set correctly.
