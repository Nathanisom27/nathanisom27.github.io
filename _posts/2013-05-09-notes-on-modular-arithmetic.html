<p>Looking at equations of the type:</p>
<p>ax+b=c(mod n) where {a,b,c} are numbers, x is unknown, and equation is mod n.</p>
<p>Example from book:</p>
<p>3x+2=4(mod 5)</p>
<p>3x+2+3=4+3(mod 5) to eliminate 2, by turning it into a 5, because 5(mod 5)=0</p>
<p>3x = 2(mod 5)</p>
<p>2*3x=2*2(mod 5)</p>
<p>6x = 4 (mod 5)</p>
<p>x = 4(mod 5)</p>
<p>So, one variable sided modular arithmetic isn't that bad, but the current problem I have is with two x's on either side:</p>
<p>4x+7=x+2(mod 10)</p>
<p>Oh balls. Okay, so I was just intimidated by the fact the mod was in the equation. You can simply subtract an x from each side and solve from there. :D</p>
