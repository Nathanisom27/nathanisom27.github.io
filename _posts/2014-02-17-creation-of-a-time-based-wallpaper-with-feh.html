<p>One of the most popular posts of all time over in /r/wallpapers is an album set of 8 8-bit landscapes for every time of day. Here is a quick glimpse:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="1152"]<img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/axNNqyH.png" width="1152" height="648" /> summary picture![/caption]</p>
<p>If you use feh to manage you background, the current background filename is stored in ~/.fehbg. If you name each picture in the 8 picture set 01 - 09, you can easily set an appropriate picture to the time of day.</p>
<p>Here is the bash script I am currently using to do this:</p>
<blockquote><p>imagepath="/home/neeasade/images/8bitday";<br />
while :<br />
do<br />
if echo 0$(expr $(date +%H) / 3).png != cat /home/neeasade/.fehbg | egrep '[0-9]{2}.png'; then<br />
feh --bg-fill $imagepath/0$(expr $(date +%H) / 3).png;<br />
fi<br />
sleep 5<br />
done</p></blockquote>
<p>The above while runs forever, checking the name of the current background picture at an interval of 5 seconds. Since there are 8 pictures in the total group, you can take the current hour of the day(out of 24) divided by 3 using integer division. running this in the background on startup as been giving me a nice wallpaper to match the time of day!</p>
