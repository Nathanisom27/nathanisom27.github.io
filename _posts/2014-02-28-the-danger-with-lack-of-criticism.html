<p>Without any feedback, how do you grow? An asshole will never stop being an asshole if no one confronts him or gives him an indication that he is being an ass. In order for immature people to 'grow up' they need to first realize that they are being immature. This is probably one of my biggest fears - as an adult, there might not be alot of flak that people give you. You must actively seek guidance and let people know that you are seeking to improve yourself. This is hard for some people. It involves cutting past the bullshit/niceties that people may typically use, and you have to accept that you might not like everything you hear.</p>
<p>I feel it is a non-issue once discussed, but if you never seek said criticism, after a time period, you can really start to doubt yourself/your competence in what you do. Whether what you do means your job, your classes, or your overall path in life. Note that I am not referring to validation in this case -- know the difference. Sometimes you don't really want criticism, you only wantÂ <em>good</em> criticism. and confusing that with constructive feedback can be dangerous.</p>
<p>Meh.</p>
