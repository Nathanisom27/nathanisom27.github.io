<p>The other day, I was really craving android development, mostly due to the fact that it was something I half-assed started this semester. Then this <a title="Android Start Guide" href="http://ootpapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Android-App-Development-Cheat-Sheet-ootpapps.com-Publication.pdf" target="_blank">glorious cheat-sheet start guide</a> for creating an app with eclipse appeared and I had a new project to work on. I think for an initial project on Android it would be good to go with Tetris, as it something that has been done many times before, and I am certain common piece algorithms exist.</p>
<p>Hm. Going to go look that up now.</p>
<p>Alright, so according to <a title="Tetris information" href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/61765/is-the-determination-of-which-tetris-block-comes-next-random" target="_blank">this</a>, Tetris pieces are generated in 3 different fashions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Completely Random</span></li>
<li>"Fairly" Random - assuring an equal amount of pieces get distributed over time.</li>
<li>"Bastet" generation - which is where the piece most likely to do harm to the player is picked.</li>
</ul>
<p>For my implementation, it would probably be easiest to simply be completely random with the pieces, so that is what I will do at first. Later, as a challenge, I will add an option for Bastet Tetris.</p>
<p>After playing a little bit of <a title="Bastet" href="http://blahg.res0l.net/2009/01/bastet-bastard-tetris/" target="_blank">Bastet Tetris</a>, it certainly feels like this:</p>

<p>Looks like it will be time to brush up on the old Java skills. It will take some getting used to after all the recent experience in visual studio.</p>
