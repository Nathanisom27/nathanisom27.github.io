<p>This post really changed my outlook on friendship and the getting close to people awhile ago, so I thought I'd leave it here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1cbepj/i_have_practically_zero_friends/c9ew3ef">post</a>, by /u/Anotherfuckwit:</p>
<p>"Here's the thing. I looked at this and immediately saw myself 20-30 years ago. I just didn't get it. I was a nice guy, never did anyone any wrong and saw jerkoffs getting all the attention, girls, friends and kudos. What was wrong with the world?</p>
<p>I'd had plenty of heart-2-hearts with people along the way and none appeared to answer the question of why I had no/few friends.</p>
<p>Then, one day, like being slapped in the face with a wet kipper someone I knew pointed out a simple fact to me and there it was.</p>
<p>I was a bit older and a bit drunk at a with a friend, who was incredibly popular. He was going away on a golf weekend and wanted to know why I wasn't going. I said that I didn't feel like I was part of the 'clique' and felt I was only ever really invited to play as an afterthought to make up a foursome. It really pissed me off that geeks like xxxxx and yyyyy would be invited regularly but not me.</p>
<p>He said, "Anotherfuckwit, when have you ever invited me to play golf? I get invites from xxxxx and yyyyy and zzzzz and all of the others and they all make a point of arranging a game and inviting people to play. From there we end up arranging more games and the invited become circular. You're a great guy, and a lovely fella but you have never once arranged a game of golf and invited anyone to play."</p>
<p>What a cock I had been. How many years of my life had I wasted waiting for some party invite or phone call that would never come because I'd been sitting like a beggar in a street waiting for handouts. People didn't invite me because they had no reason to believe I liked them or wanted to be in their company. All people have their own insecurities and very few are going to make an effort to include someone if they feel it won't be received or reciprocated.</p>
<p>We all want to feel liked. That means the people you want to like you, want to know you to like them first. (Sorry for the tongue twister there).</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR If you want others to be your friend, act like a friend to them.</strong></p>
<p>*edit: goodness me - I've just woken up to all this! Thank you for all the lovely comments and if any of you DO begin to make more friends as a result of this then please let me know - I'm genuinely interested and will be very grateful to hear about it.</p>
<p>I've read every comment and fully understand those who are questioning my perspective so here's another couple of thoughts: I'm merely saying "if you want to win the lottery, first you need to buy a ticket." To those who say "This is rubbish because I bought a ticket once but didn't win." Well... Best of luck to you, perhaps try a lottery with smaller odds?</p>
<p>Also, this is not about becoming the lead of some shallow group of hangouts - more about putting as much interest and effort into forming and keeping relationships going as you'd like others to do with you.</p>
<p>And to those who are saying "this is obvious! Nothing new here!" I agree entirely - I just wish I'd known it when I was younger."</p>
