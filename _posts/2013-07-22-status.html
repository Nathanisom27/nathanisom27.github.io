<p>The night is young and I am coding. The current project I have is a picture sorter in c#. The photographer that my mom uses has one strategy, it seems: take as many pictures as possible, and then sort through them in a painfully slow way. Open up windows default image viewer, remember the number if you like the picture, and then go copy the file into the next directory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watching this process was painful. Will be posting a github later tonight of my progress. The idea is to use a background thread to preload the images into memory before they are needed to be displayed, reducing the time needed to sort through them(windows image viewer takes forever). The front end is done, and work on a picManager object to manage the picture themselves has begun. Currently jamming on caffeine and raging to go, so posting here before the night is afoot.</p>

<p>Aside from programming, the guys at work have all started playing minecraft and torchlight 2 together. TC2 went on sale for $5 several times over the course of the recent steam sales. With 6 people playing, it gets chaotic, but it worth it and way awesome. The server we play on has the feed the beast(FTB) mod pack, which includes this wonderful thing called a turtle. A turtle is a portable computer block that you can program to mine and craft for you!<br />
I expect to be posting turtle scripts either here or on github, as they are in Lua, a popular scripting language with plenty of reference material.</p>
