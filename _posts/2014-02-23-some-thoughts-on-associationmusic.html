<p>There is something to be said for the power of music.. About a half hour ago, I was sitting at my desk, essentially staring into space. Computer had just rebooted, things were quiet, I was looking semi-longingly at my bed. However, my headphones beconed, and some lovely upbeat trance greeted my ears.</p>
<p>I have attempted to purposefully make it a habit to listen to the same mixes at work as I do the things I do - That is, if I'm not doing jack, or I'm eating lunch, typically my headphones are away and I am not doing much. Now, I know that there have been studies on the power of music and the general conclusion is that music doesn't make that much of a difference in ones work ethic, but I'm not necessarily referring to that. I am referring to the effects of repeatedly listening to the same mix or set of music when you do an activity.</p>
<p>For example, my current set playlist is the one that I typically listen too while programming or pursuing projects at work. The second I slipped my headphones on, I felt the urge to start typing and doing things, but I didn't have anything up/ready to go at the moment, so I started typing this.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Okay so I promptly passed out after taking off my headphones to go to the bathroom. Weird. The point of the above is that by associating different types of music with different types of activities, it can be easier to do/start doing those activities. It will probably take some repetition to get the two things 'connected' in your mind, by after that happens, motivation will start to flow pretty naturally.</p>
