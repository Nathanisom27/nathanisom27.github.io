<p>Yesterday my birthday keyboard arrived from California.</p>
<p>When the decision for what keybaord to get came around, I had two choices :</p>
<p>- Wait for the CODE mechanical keyboard to come back into stock with some MX greens.</p>
<p>- purchase a WASD v2 with some MX greens.</p>
<p>The main difference is that with the CODE keyboard I would have had backlit keys, but they all would have been the same color. Whereas with the WASD, I was able to choose the color of all the keys. This is what I ended up doing(as the title indicates) and decided to match the colorscheme of the keys to what I currently have at work. That and I got to pick some Tux OS keys ;). I waited 2 weeks before letting impatience get the better of me and ordering the WASD.</p>
<p>Anyway, here she is :</p>
