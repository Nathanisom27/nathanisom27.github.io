#+title: Creation of a time based wallpaper with feh 

One of the most popular posts of all time over in /r/wallpapers is an
album set of 8 8-bit landscapes for every time of day. Here is a quick
glimpse:

If you use feh to manage you background, the current background filename
is stored in ~/.fehbg. If you name each picture in the 8 picture set
01 - 09, you can easily set an appropriate picture to the time of day.

Here is the bash script I am currently using to do this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  imagepath="/home/neeasade/images/8bitday";\\
  while :\\
  do\\
  if echo 0$(expr $(date +%H) / 3).png != cat /home/neeasade/.fehbg |
  egrep '[0-9]{2}.png'; then\\
  feh --bg-fill $imagepath/0$(expr $(date +%H) / 3).png;\\
  fi\\
  sleep 5\\
  done
#+END_QUOTE

The above while runs forever, checking the name of the current
background picture at an interval of 5 seconds. Since there are 8
pictures in the total group, you can take the current hour of the
day(out of 24) divided by 3 using integer division. running this in the
background on startup as been giving me a nice wallpaper to match the
time of day!
