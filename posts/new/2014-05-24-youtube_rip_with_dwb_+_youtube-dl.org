#+title: youtube rip with dwb + youtube-dl

Just finished a snippet that can be used in combination with dwb(or many
other browsers, probably) to auto download a youtube video and convert
it to audio using [[file:rg3.github.io/youtube-dl][youtube-dl]].

{% highlight bash linenos %} #!/bin/bash #dwb: xf
download\_dir=/my/media/dir youtube-dl -x -o
$download\_dir'/%(uploader)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s' $DWB\_URI {%
endhighlight %}

It can probably be noted that I had some trouble with the youtube-dl
naming syntax at first - the '%(title)s' and such needs to be in a
string or else bash freaks out. Also this will fail without ffmpeg, as
that is a dep for audio conversion with youtube-dl.
