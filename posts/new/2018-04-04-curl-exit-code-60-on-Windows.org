#+title: curl exit code 60 on Windows

Many times the =curl= tool version available to you on windows is
outdated and doesn't ship with up to date ca certs. A workaround for
this is to grab the latest =cacert.pem= from curl
[[http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html][here]] in the same location
as curl, and rename it to =curl-ca-bundle.crt=. Thanks to
[[https://superuser.com/questions/442793/why-cant-curl-properly-verify-a-certificate-on-windows][Cheeso]]
for the solution. I ran into this while trying to use =emacs-request= on
windows.
