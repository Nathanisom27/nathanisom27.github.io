#+title: VirtualBox setup on Arch Linux - Misc 

99% of this should apply for other distros as well.

So, where I currently work, to work via a remote connection, we must be
using a windows machine, or else we get a nice little message informing
us that our OS is not supported by their remote service. This can be a
tad annoying at times.

Regardless of the reason, a nice virtual machine can be very usefull to
have.

Enter virtualbox, currently available from the virtualbox package on
most repos.

Note: on Arch, you may have to use the "" command before starting
VirtBox, if you get an error on startup concerning kernel modules.

I primarily use
[[http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-24209.iso][windows7 x64]],
but there are
[[http://www.w7forums.com/threads/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-image-downloads.12325/][many
versions]] available for use, officially from microsoft.

After setting up a new machine, you can mount the ISO onto it and
install as if to a regular hard drive.

POST installation:

There is an extension to virtual box that allows you to do some pretty
cool things, such as emulate multiple monitors or use a window outside
of the virtual window.

This extension is installed via an ISO provided by the virtualbox
website:

http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/

just navigate to your version, download and mount from there.
