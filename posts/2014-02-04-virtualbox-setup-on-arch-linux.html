<p>99% of this should apply for other distros as well.</p>
<p>So, where I currently work, to work via a remote connection, we must be using a windows machine, or else we get a nice little message informing us that our OS is not supported by their remote service. This can be a tad annoying at times.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason, a nice virtual machine can be very usefull to have.</p>
<p>Enter virtualbox, currently available from the virtualbox package on most repos.</p>
<p>Note: on Arch, you may have to use the "" command before starting VirtBox, if you get an error on startup concerning kernel modules.</p>
<p>I primarily use <a href="http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-24209.iso">windows7 x64</a>, but there are <a href="http://www.w7forums.com/threads/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-image-downloads.12325/">many versions</a> available for use, officially from microsoft.</p>
<p>After setting up a new machine, you can mount the ISO onto it and install as if to a regular hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>POST installation:</p>
<p>There is an extension to virtual box that allows you to do some pretty cool things, such as emulate multiple monitors or use a window outside of the virtual window.</p>
<p>This extension is installed via an ISO provided by the virtualbox website:</p>
<p>http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/</p>
<p>just navigate to your version, download and mount from there.</p>
