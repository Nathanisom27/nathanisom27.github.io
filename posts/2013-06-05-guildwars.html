<p>Today, I found myself traversing centaur camps whilst trying to complete the Arathi Hinterlands. I was on my way to the skill point at the far east of the map, running my way past hordes of enemies, using my speed-up abilities and shield spells. Progress was slow, and after about a half hour, I had had enough. I turned around and started to head back, only to be greeted by a group of about a dozen players who were efficiently making a path through the centaur camps. I had stumbled upon a server event that was going the same way I was. Sticking with them for the next half hour made the skill point reachable, as there were others trying to acquire that achievement also.</p>
