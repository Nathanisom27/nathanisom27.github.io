#+title: fortune quotes
#+pubdate: <2021-01-04>

[[https://monade.li][Na√Øm]] has a nice ~gitconfig~ alias that they use for all their dotfiles repo commits:

#+begin_src
[alias]
    cf = !git commit -m \"$(fortune -sn 60)\"
#+end_src

Sometimes nice stuff comes out, sometimes not so nice stuff comes out. This page will be a random 50 fortune quotes (called with the same args) each time the site is generated:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results raw :exports results
(s-join
"\n"
	(-map
	 (lambda (_)
	   (format
	    "%s\n#+begin_quote\n%s\n#+end_quote\n"
	    (ns/blog-make-hsep)
	    (s-replace "\n" "\n\n"
		       (ns/shell-exec "fortune -sn 60"))))
	 (range 50)))
#+end_src
