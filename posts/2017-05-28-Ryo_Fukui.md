Ryo Fukui was a Japanese jazz pianist. He learned to play the piano at 22 and 6 years later released his debut album _Scenery_ in 1976. He passed away in 2016. Today, you can find most of his released work online. One album that has escaped is _My Favourite Tune_(1995). A youtuber with the handle _Marcel The Drunkard_ had a Japanese contact that evidently recorded many of the original bootlegs of Fukui's work([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/translator/comments/5n8ckh/japanese_english_comment_about_music/?utm_name=frontpage)), but he did not have a copy.

Here are youtube links to his(often with other artists) albums at this time:
