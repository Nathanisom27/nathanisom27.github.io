#+title: More gw2 API released - Programming 

ArenaNet has release a new API for integrating map tiles into a web
page. Basic example [[http://jsfiddle.net/cliff/CRRGC/][here]]. Combined
with the events API they released about a month ago, this makes for an
interesting project. Perhaps path or quest plotting? someone has already
made [[http://naturallydelicio.us/map/][a map for the browser]]. I now
have my project for the weekend.
