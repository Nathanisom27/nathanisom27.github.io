<p>After setting your correct locale in the etc/locale.gen file and running locale-gen, your system wide language gets set in Linux. Some applications, however, reference the LANG variable in order to determine language type. One in particular that I am fond of is sublime text. This isn't an issue until you install the package manager - which you will probably want to do eventually.</p>
<p>A temporary fix, as the error logged will inform you, is to set the LANG variable either before or with the startup of sublime text.</p>
<p>However, this may not always be viable, and can be annoying. There are two solutions to set this variable upon system startup.</p>
<p>A "hacky" way to get around this problem would be to set the LANG variable within your .bashrc file, as such:</p>
<blockquote><p>export LANG ="en_US.UTF-8"</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the above only sets the variable for your user/login session.</p>
<p>To set the LANG variable system wide(the prefferred method), edit or create the file /etc/locale.conf to contain:</p>
<blockquote><p>LANG ="en_US.UTF-8"</p></blockquote>
<p>And upon restart your LANG variable will be set correctly.</p>
