Most executable text files in Linux start with a shebang (=#!=) to tell the OS what program to run the file with. What happens is a process is spawned with the program in the shebang, with the file as the first argument. IE, when you call some file =$HOME/hello.sh=:

#+begin_src
#!/usr/bin/bash
echo "hello world!"
#+end_src

A process is created with the call structure =/usr/bin/bash
