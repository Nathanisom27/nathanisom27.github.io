<p>ArenaNet has release a new API for integrating map tiles into a web page. Basic example <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/cliff/CRRGC/">here</a>. Combined with the events API they released about a month ago, this makes for an interesting project. Perhaps path or quest plotting? someone has already made <a href="http://naturallydelicio.us/map/">a map for the browser</a>. I now have my project for the weekend.</p>
