<p>
Ryo Fukui was a Japanese jazz pianist. He learned to play the piano at
22 and 6 years later released his debut album <i>Scenery</i> in 1976. He
passed away in 2016. Today, you can find most of his released work
online. One album that has escaped is <i>My Favourite Tune/(1995). A
youtuber with the handle /Marcel The Drunkard</i> had a Japanese contact
that evidently recorded many of the original bootlegs of Fukui's
work(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/translator/comments/5n8ckh/japanese_english_comment_about_music/?utm_name=frontpage">link</a>),
but he did not have a copy.
