<p>
Alright, so, after quite a bit of trial and error, I finally have my
laptop configured the way I want it to be. In a duel boot with
CrunchBang(#!) and Windows 7. Windows is necessary for compatibility of
certain software(e.g. Visual Studio and Microsoft Office). Initially
when configuring this, I simply shrank the windows partition of the hard
drive in the Windows hard drive manager, and then followed the steps off
of the #! cd. to my dismay, this broke the windows installation and
rendered it unable to boot. There was no worry though, as I was able to
access all the windows files and back them up. After much off and on,
the solution was to install windows on an initially small partition,
then install Ubuntu into the free space, and finally replace the Ubuntu
partitions with the #! installation. kind of loopy, but this way the
grub loader works with both windows and #!. So far openbox, conky, and
terminator have been a blast configuring, and with the ability to
rdesktop into my home windows computer, I can effectively develop for
Windows from #! as well.
